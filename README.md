1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?
 Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This allows for early detection of problems and automated testing whenever new code is pushed.

2. No. Unit testing is better to test if function is working properly.

3. No, the message feature is too big of a scope for unit testing.

4. Yes, as max_length function returns a value and not a complex outfput which can be easily tested with unit testing.
